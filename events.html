Annual day performances include songs, dances, skits, and stand-up comedy.</h3>

    <h3>Sports days are events staged by our school in which students participate in competitive sporting activities, with the aim of winning trophies or prizes. Our school uses the concept of four houses, and all the students are divided into said houses. At the end of the year, the houses are graded according to their overall score, and the house with the highest score receives a trophy.</h3>
