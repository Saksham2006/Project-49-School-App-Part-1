    <h2>About me</h2>
    <h3>I, Saksham Seth, am a 15 year old student studying in the class IX of Lokhandwala Foundation School, who started studying in LFS in class VII. Before the start of class IX, we were given many different choices, to choose between subjects like Mathematics, Science, Economy, Commerce, Management, Computers, Arts etc. This is a great opportunity for students to take up subjects that they would like to focus on later on in life.    </h3>
    <h2>My awards</h2>
    <h3>I have received multiple rewards from Lokhandwala Foundation School, which obtain good conduct awards, punctuation awards, and even awards for doing great in many different subjects.</h3>
